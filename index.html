            <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
            <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>

            <header> Flow Control In Python</header>
            <p>In Python programming, flow control is the order in which statements or blocks of code are executed at runtime based on a condition.</p>
            <p>The flow control statementsare divided into three (3) categories
                <ul>
                    <li>Conditional statements</li>
                    <li>Iterative statements</li>
                    <li>Transfer statements</li>
                </ul>

            <header> Function In Python</header>
            <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
            <p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</li>

                <li>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</li>
                <h1>syntax</h1>
            </ol>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        def functionname( parameters ):
   "function_docstring"
   function_suite
   return [expression]
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
                By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.
            </p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>
                The following function takes a string as input parameter and prints it on standard screen.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print str
   return
                </code>

            <header>Data Types In python</header>
            <p>
                In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Text Type</li>
                <li>Numeric Type</li>
                <li>Sequence Type</li>
                <li>Mapping Type</li>
                <li>Set Type</li>
                <li>Boolean Type</li>
                <li>Binary Type</li>
                <li>Non Type</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Getting the Data Type</h2>
            <p>You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:</p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>Print the data type of the variable x:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    x = 5
print(type(x))
                </code>
            </pre>

            <header>Object and Class In Python</header>
            <p>
                Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
